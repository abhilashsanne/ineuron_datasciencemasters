    "### 1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "* In Python strings, the backslash \"\\\" is a special character, also called the \"escape\" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: \"\\t\" is a tab, \"\\n\" is a newline, and \"\\r\" is a carriage return\n",
    "\n",
    "* prefixing a special character with \"\\\" turns it into an ordinary character. This is called \"escaping\". For example, \"\\'\" is the single quote character. 'It\\'s Sunday' therefore is a valid string and equivalent to \"It's Sunday\". Likewise, '\"' can be escaped: \"\\\"hello\\\"\" is a string begins and ends with the literal double quote character. Finally, \"\\\" can be used to escape itself: \"\\\\\" is the literal backslash character.\n",
